# Greenwich Blockchain Association sign-ups are open!

### Author: Paul Lechocki

We're happy to share that you're now able to sign up to be a member of our society.

In case you haven't joined yet, we invite you to do so [here.](https://www.greenwichsu.co.uk/societies/14182/)

We're still polishing the whole onboarding experience, so once we're done, we'll contact you with instructions to claim your free, virtual membership pass.

See you on the other side!
